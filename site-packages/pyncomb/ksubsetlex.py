"""An implementation of basic combinatorial k-subset operations using
lexicographic ordering.

Note that for our purposes here, sets are represented as lists as
ranking, unranking, and successor functions need a total order on the
elements of the set.

For the base set B, if B is an integer, we assume that our base set is
[0,...,B-1]. Otherwise, assume that B is a pair consisting of:
   1. a list representing the base set
   2. a reverse lookup dict, mapping elements of the base set to their
      position in the total order.
   Example: [0,3,4,2], {0:0, 3:1, 4:2, 2:3}
Note that we require B to contain the reverse lookup information to
speed up the algorithms here; otherwise, we would need to call index on
our base set many times, which would increase complexity by a factor of
the length of the base set.
